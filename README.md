#### Private 5G refers to a mobile network that is technically the same as a public
5G network, but which allows the owner to provide priority access or licensing for its
wireless spectrum. This can be beneficial when deploying private wireless networks
at facilities where coverage, speed, and security capabilities are needed beyond those
offered by Wi-Fi and other network technologies.
The point of deploying a private 5G network is to make things more efficient - not
to get mired down in the details of setting up and managing a complicated network.
The responsibility for doing that will fall on SIs, but even though they are supposed to
be the experts, running a 5G private network could be a challenge for SIs.
That’s where the software management aspects of 5G come in - and just as end-users
expect all network capabilities to be automated, SIs can take advantage of software
to implement features like dynamic spectrum management to power their network.
Enhancing the networks with those features - thus reducing the skillsets SIs need to implement
to deploy and manage networks - will enable SIs to serve even more customers
more successfully. Thus, SIs need to build or acquire automated software management
systems to make their customers’ 5G dreams come true.
In this project, i have tried to simulate and develop a web application by which we
can manage and monitor a facilities, companies private network, the devices connected
in that private network,blocking the potential harmful devices and IPs.
This system has sign-up, login features, in private networks normally one admin controls
the system, here we can add more admin to the system and login. basically
three servers as MVC (model, view, control) design pattern talking each other and
transmitting data between each other.
