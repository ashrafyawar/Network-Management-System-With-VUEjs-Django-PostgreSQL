                    GTU Network Management System is a 5G Private Networks Managment Software,
                    in order to use this system first you need to sign up and if you are eligible,
                    the system will create and account for you and then you
                    will be redirected to the login page
                </p>
                <h4>
                  Why This System?
                </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    Private 5G networks are beginning to take off. According to one study, three fourths of the manufacturing organizations in Germany, 
                    Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States aim to adopt private 5G networks by 2024. Another study found that among companies that 
                    are investing in private mobile networks, 44% are already using 5G and another 8% are using a combination of 5G with 4G LTE. Private 5G networks 
                    are emerging as the connectivity technology of choice for driving next-generation enterprise transformation in a growing list of industries such 
                    as manufacturing, automotive, utilities, and mining. Having spent over two decades in the Telco sphere, I believe that what we’re witnessing are 
                    the first stages of exponential growth. Let's see what's behind it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       Private 5G networks fall into two deployment models: large-scale deployments with vertically-integrated 
                       dedicated hardware, and cloud-native with lightweight deployments using hyperscaler products. One is CAPEX heavy, 
                       and is often chosen by large organizations with enough capital to support the initial investment, as well as the IT 
                       resources to support its maintenance. With an estimated lifespan of ten years, companies that can afford to go the hardware 
                       route can look forward to an impressive ROI. In contrast, cloud-native systems have very low up-front costs, with users paying for 
                       them as-a-service. This model is becoming increasingly popular, due to the ease of getting started and the ongoing support. The cloud-native 
                       architecture of private networks also goes along well with the cloud-native architecture of microservices and other IT applications for a wider range of use cases.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Our system provides fast, reliable and accountable product for any kind of compus and facility private networks.

                      Super users will have full contorl of the the system and will be able to do any kind of possible changes on the system that the system allows in super user level.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Inorder to become a super user, first create a super user account by signing up into the system.
